# General information 
The program RIblast can be found: https://github.com/amatria/RIblast

## Installation 
I created a folder in the work directory: `/cluster/work/users/magdalena/lncrna/11_lncRNA_interaction` in which I git cloned the repository. I switched into the RIblast directory and executed `make`. 


## Execution 

I copied the transcripts (coming from gffread) and the extracted lncRNA transcripts into the work directory. 

I created two scripts: 
1) to create the database 
2) to search my query transcript sequences against the created database
