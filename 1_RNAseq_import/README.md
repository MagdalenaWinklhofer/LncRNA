# General information 

The RNA sequencing was performed 2015 and the data are stored in the directory: `/cluster/projects/nn8014k/rnaseq2015`. The sequences were tested with the FastQC program and it was determined that the sequences are trimmed and have a good quality. 

# Data import (13.03.2024)
Sequencing data were copied from the storage directory into the work directory `/cluster/work/users/magdalena/lncrna/1_sequences`. 

# Quality assessment (13.03.2024)
The quality was assessed with Fastqc and the script `1_fastqc_RNAseq2015.sh`.
